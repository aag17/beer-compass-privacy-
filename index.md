**Last updated:** June 6, 2025

Booze Compass (“we,” “our,” or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains:

2. How we use that information  
3. Where and how we store it  
4. How you can contact us with questions

---

## 1. Information We Collect

**Location Data**  
• We request only your precise location while you use the app—to show nearby beer-selling stores and point you there.  
• This data is used on the device and combined with public Georgia license records to calculate distances and open/closed status.  
• We do not store your location data on our servers.

**Crash Reports & Analytics (Optional)**  
• We do not collect any personally identifiable analytics data.  
• If you enable anonymous crash reporting via a third-party SDK, that data is not tied to you personally.

---

## 2. How We Use Your Information

• **Location** is used solely to display nearby licensed stores and power the in-app compass arrow.  
• We do not sell, rent, or share your location with any third parties.  
• We do not collect personal identifiers like name, email, or device ID for any purpose.

---

## 3. Data Storage & Retention

• No user location data is ever saved on our servers. All processing is done locally on your device.  
• If you choose to share a location with a friend, that is done via the standard iOS “Share” sheet—no data is uploaded to us.

---

## 4. Children’s Privacy

Booze Compass not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from anyone under 13.

---

## 5. Third-Party Services

Our app may utilize third-party services (Apple Maps, Google Maps) for location and mapping features. Each third-party service may have its own privacy policy; we encourage you to review them as necessary.

---

## 6. Your Choices

**Location Permissions**  
• You can choose to allow location access only while using the app. Disabling location access may limit the app’s functionality.  

**Data Deletion**  
• Since we do not store any personal data on our servers, there is no personal data to delete. Any data stored locally on your device (like favorites) can be removed by uninstalling the app.
